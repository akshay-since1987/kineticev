## Key Salesforce Custom Field IDs

## Files Modified So Far

### âœ… Completed Changes:
- `php/config.php` - Added environment detection and config merging system
- `php/dev-config.php` - Added comprehensive Salesforce field mappings for development
- `php/test-config.php` - Added comprehensive Salesforce field mappings for test/staging  
- `php/prod-config.php` - Added comprehensive Salesforce field mappings for production
- `php/SalesforceService.php` - Updated to use environment-specific config-based mappings

### ðŸŽ¯ Migration Complete:
- Environment-specific configuration system fully implemented
- All Salesforce field mappings moved to appropriate config files
- Automatic environment detection based on domain/host
- Config merging system handles environment-specific overrides
- No hardcoded field IDs remain in codebase

## Notes & Considerations

1. **Environment Detection**: Need to determine how environment is detected (file presence, environment variable, etc.)

2. **Field ID Differences**: Different Salesforce orgs may have different custom field IDs

3. **Value Mapping Consistency**: Ensure value transformations are consistent across environments

4. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing functionality during migration

5. **Testing Strategy**: Plan for testing in each environment without affecting live data

## Migration Benefits

- âœ… **Environment Isolation**: Different field mappings per environment
- âœ… **Configuration Management**: Easy updates without code changes  
- âœ… **Deployment Flexibility**: Environment-specific configurations
- âœ… **Maintainability**: Centralized field mapping definitions
- âœ… **Documentation**: Clear mapping structure and purposes

**Status**: âœ… MIGRATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

## ðŸŽ‰ Implementation Summary

The Salesforce field mapping migration has been successfully completed with enhanced domain detection! The system now supports:

### Environment Detection System (Enhanced)
The system automatically detects the environment using multiple methods:
1. **Environment Variables**: `KINETIC_ENV` (preferred)
2. **Server Variables**: `$_SERVER['KINETIC_ENV']` 
3. **Enhanced Domain Analysis**: Robust hostname detection with port support
   - **Production**: `kineticev.in`, `www.kineticev.in`
   - **Test/Staging**: `test.kineticev.in`
   - **Development**: `dev.kineticev.in`, `local.kineticev.in`, `localhost`
   - **Port Handling**: Automatic port stripping (e.g., `dev.kineticev.in:3000` â†’ development)
4. **Fallback**: Defaults to development for safety

### Configuration Merging
- Base configuration in `config.php` is merged with environment-specific configs
- Environment configs take precedence for overlapping settings
- Recursive merging preserves nested array structures
- Environment info is added to final config for debugging

### Benefits Achieved
- âœ… **Environment Isolation**: Different field mappings per environment with automatic detection
- âœ… **Zero Code Changes**: Update field mappings without touching PHP code
- âœ… **Enhanced Domain Support**: Handles multiple domain formats and port numbers
- âœ… **Automatic Detection**: No manual environment switching required
- âœ… **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality preserved
- âœ… **Centralized Management**: All field mappings in config files
- âœ… **Production Ready**: Proper field ID handling per Salesforce org
- âœ… **Development Flexibility**: Support for local, dev, and port-based development URLs

The migration is complete and ready for deployment across all environments with robust domain detection!
